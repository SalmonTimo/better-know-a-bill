# Better Know A Bill
An LLM application that indexes 1,000+ page congressional bills for retrieval augmented generation of questions and answers in an attempt to make the content of these large bills more accessible to the public, so taxpayers can better understand where their dollars are going.

Current state is a hackathon style MVP that RAGs over the 2024 omnibus bill. That same MVP will be applied to the 2025 "Big Beautiful Bill". The eventual goal will be to scale this to indexing and serving queries on all legislative bills.
